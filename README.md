  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
  I'm Shannen T. Nazareno, a 2nd-year BS Information Systems college student from University of San Carlos. I am an aspiring fullstack developer and/or data analyst. Coding plays a huge part in my life. Aside from being able to think 'ouside-the-box' and propose such solutions, it gives me sense of control. Back in 2018-2019, I had been introduced already with the concepts of web development (only a few). Yet, I want to excel more on this field as a college student in this institution.

  <h2>Projects</h2>
   <p>More projects will be pushed soon (such as websites, programs rather than using the C language) as they are yet to be modified. </p>
